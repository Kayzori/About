          <h2>About Me</h2>

          <p>Hi! Iâ€™m Mahdi also known as username Kayzori, an 18-year-old developer from Algeria. Iâ€™ve been coding for 4 years â€” with over 3 years of experience in Godot and about 1.5 years in C/C++.</p>
          <p>I first got into programming out of pure curiosity and the challenge of pushing myself to reach higher levels. Most of my learning has been self-driven through personal research, tutorials, and online resources, since I often find university courses donâ€™t go deep enough into real-world projects.</p>
          <p>Currently, Iâ€™m studying at U.S.T.O in Oran, Algeria, where Iâ€™ve completed my first year and am now in the second.</p>
          <p>I especially enjoy working with low-level languages like C and C++ because of their performance and the control they give over machines, devices, and software. On the other side, Iâ€™m also passionate about game development â€” Iâ€™ve been building projects in Godot for over 3 years, which has taught me a lot about algorithms and how they can be visualized through game mechanics.</p>
          <p>For me, coding is not just a skill â€” itâ€™s a way of solving problems creatively and turning curiosity into something real.  Most of my projects are solo, but Iâ€™d really enjoy meeting new people, building connections, and eventually working with a team. At the moment, I donâ€™t belong to any community â€” but Iâ€™m open and excited to join one in the future.</p>
          <p>Outside of coding, I love playing games and going on trips, also doing pixel art and sometimes reading docs from reddit, stackoverflow, pdfs..., and watching real world projects on yt to expand my knowledge</p>

        <h2>Skills</h2>

        <p>I have a good foundation in low-level programming languages, especially C and C++. I enjoy working close to the hardware because it gives me precise control over performance and memory management. Over the past 1.5 years, Iâ€™ve built some sub-projects that taught me how to optimize algorithms and understand how programs interact with machines.</p>
        <p>In addition to low-level coding, I have over 3 years of experience developing games using the Godot Engine. Through these projects, Iâ€™ve gained practical skills in game mechanics, scene design, physics, animations, and AI programming. Visualizing algorithms as interactive elements in a game has also significantly improved my problem-solving abilities.</p>
        <p>Iâ€™m comfortable learning independently and applying new technologies quickly. Whether itâ€™s exploring advanced C++ features, mastering engine tools in Godot, I always strive to push my skills further. I also enjoy experimenting with graphics, shaders, and performance optimization to create efficient and visually appealing projects.</p>
        <p>Overall, my skills combine "low-level programming expertise", "game development experience", and a "curious, self-driven mindset", enabling me to tackle both technical challenges and creative projects.</p>
