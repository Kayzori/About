        <h2>About Me</h2>

				<p>Hi! I’m Mahdi, an 18-year-old developer from Algeria. I’ve been coding for 4 years — with over 3 years of experience in Godot and about 1.5 years in C/C++.</p>

				<p>I first got into programming out of pure curiosity and the challenge of pushing myself to reach higher levels. Most of my learning has been self-driven through personal research, tutorials, and online resources, since I often find university courses don’t go deep enough into real-world projects.</p>

				<p>Currently, I’m studying at U.S.T.O in Oran, Algeria, where I’ve completed my first year and am now in the second.</p>

				<p>I especially enjoy working with low-level languages like C and C++ because of their performance and the control they give over machines, devices, and software. On the other side, I’m also passionate about game development — I’ve been building projects in Godot for over 3 years, which has taught me a lot about algorithms and how they can be visualized through game mechanics.</p>

				<p>For me, coding is not just a skill — it’s a way of solving problems creatively and turning curiosity into something real.</p>

				<p>Outside of coding, I love playing games and going on trips. Most of my projects are solo, but I’d really enjoy meeting new people, building connections, and eventually working with a team. At the moment, I don’t belong to any community — but I’m open and excited to join one in the future.</p>

        <h2>About My Skills</h2>

				<p>I have a good foundation in low-level programming languages, especially C and C++. I enjoy working close to the hardware because it gives me precise control over performance and memory management. Over the past 1.5 years, I’ve built some sub-projects that taught me how to optimize algorithms and understand how programs interact with machines.</p>

				<p>In addition to low-level coding, I have over 3 years of experience developing games using the Godot Engine. Through these projects, I’ve gained practical skills in game mechanics, scene design, physics, animations, and AI programming. Visualizing algorithms as interactive elements in a game has also significantly improved my problem-solving abilities.</p>

				<p>I’m comfortable learning independently and applying new technologies quickly. Whether it’s exploring advanced C++ features, mastering engine tools in Godot, I always strive to push my skills further. I also enjoy experimenting with graphics, shaders, and performance optimization to create efficient and visually appealing projects.</p>

				<p>Overall, my skills combine "low-level programming expertise", "game development experience", and a "curious, self-driven mindset", enabling me to tackle both technical challenges and creative projects.</p>
